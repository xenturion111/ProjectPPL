## Running the demo

:

1. [Head to CometChat Pro and create an account](https://app.cometchat.com/signup)
2. From the [dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/apps), add a new app called **"slack-clone"**
3. Select this newly added app from the list.
4. From the Quick Start copy the **APP_ID, APP_REGION and AUTH_KEY**. These will be used later.
5. Also copy the **REST_API_KEY** from the API & Auth Key tab.
6. Navigate to the Users tab, and delete all the default users and groups leaving it clean **(very important)**.
7. Download the repository [here](https://github.com/Daltonic/slack-clone/archive/master.zip) or by running `git clone https://github.com/Daltonic/slack-clone.git` and open it in a code editor.
8. [Head to Firebase and create a new project](https://console.firebase.google.com)
9. Create a file called **app.config.js** in the **src** folder of your project.
10. Import and inject your secret keys in the **app.config.js** file containing your CometChat and Firebase in this manner.

```js
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  authDomain: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  databaseURL: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  projectId: 'xxx-xxx-xxx',
  storageBucket: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  messagingSenderId: 'xxx-xxx-xxx',
  appId: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  measurementId: 'xxx-xxx-xxx',
}

const cometChat = {
  APP_ID: 'xxx-xxx-xxx',
  AUTH_KEY: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  REST_KEY: 'xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
  APP_REGION: 'xx',
}

export { firebaseConfig, cometChat }
```

11. Make sure to exclude **app.config.js** in your gitIgnore file from being exposed online.
12. Run the following command to install the app.

```sh
    npm install
    npm start
```
